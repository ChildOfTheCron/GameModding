Another light-weight mod I made for the Skyrim base game. Super basic. It adds alchemy skill experience when picking or finding ingredients. Also you gain a smaller amount of alchemy skill experience when drinking potions.

The maths:
I could not find a way to get the current skill experience level for alchemy or any skill tree. As such I cannot do percentile increases. Unfortunately increasing things by a flat amount leads to either super overpowered early game leveling or super nerfed end game leveling. So I figured I'd try a halfway-house.

Experience rewarded when picking ingredients is PlayerLevel+50\*20.
Experience rewarded when drinking potions is PlayerLevel+50\*10.

This seems to be pretty balanced for a level 1-4 character and a level 22-24 character so fingers crossed it is ok.

I made this as it seems to me that Alchemy doesn't scale as well as other skills in the game. I'm hoping this is an immersive way to balance it a little bit.
