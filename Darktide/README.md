## loadinglore

This mod will overwrite the default loading screen messages to instead include a 74 new helpful tips sourced from the community (see https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/11j9o7f/help_me_with_my_mod_anything_you_wish_you_knew/). The user can select which kind of tips they'd like to see from the mod menu. The tips cover a lot of basic and not so basic things for example:

What rending does
What finesse does
Reminding players to leave ammo for the Vet if possible
Remind users to tag resources and work as a team but not be annoying
How to avoid a daemon host
How blocking works
How stamina works
What hitmass is
and much much more!
    
There are also a couple of more generic lore bits, such as famous quotes from books or famous 40k chartacters. I hope to add to this section a bit more in the future. I also added a couple of funny quotes from well known characters from the 40K books and also from well known memes (and reddit).

Because the end user might not be interested in Lore or Funny stuff and only want hints the mod allows the user to select which types of hints they will see. They can select between any combo of Lore, Gameplay or Funny categories.

If you have any quotes you'd like to see reach out to Hobo in the Darktide modding discord or leave an issue in my Github repo. I'm also really happy to accept any translations as I can only do the EN currently and my french sucks.

Huge shout out to the Darktide community who are super passionate about the game. Another huge shout out to the Darktide modding community, for being super helpful in helping me with my first ever Darktide mod!

## EggHunt

EggHunt will start an egg hunt mini game. There are 4 eggs to find, and they are (kinda) random each time you play.

There are no visiable eggs because that's not possible currently. But if you get near a location of an egg you'll hear a squishy sound play as a hint. If you hear a squishy sound, look around the immediate area. Once you walk on an egg location, you'll get a message pop up telling you you've found it! Be warned, some of them are pretty well hidden!

If you find all 4 eggs, you win the round! Great job!

How to play
• When on the Mourningstar type egg_hunt start to start the game.
• The game requires that you collect 4 eggs that are hidden around the ship.
• You'll hear a squishy sound play sometimes when you are close to an egg location!
• Once all 4 eggs are found the day is saved! And you can start over if you want.
• NOTE: You can stop the game at any time by typing egg_hunt stop.
• To play a new game or restart a current one, just type egg_hunt start again.

Known issue
Sometimes sprinting can cause the egg pickup to not work if you sprint over it. I think it's tied to framerate. Anyhow, if you get near an egg location, just don't sprint and take your time looking for it :D
